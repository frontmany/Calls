# Test System Setup - Summary

## What Was Done

Successfully restructured the test system to allow running tests from all test files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created `test_runner_base.py`
- Extracted common infrastructure from `tests.py`
- Contains:
  - `CallbacksHandler` - Event handler for test callbacks
  - `run_client()` - Function to run client in separate process
  - `run_server_in_process()` - Function to run server
  - `TestRunner` - Base class for all test classes

### 2. Updated `tests.py`
- Now imports from `test_runner_base.py`
- Renamed main class to `BasicTestRunner`
- Added `discover_and_run_all_tests()` function that:
  - Automatically discovers all test files
  - Imports test classes dynamically
  - Runs all tests with a single server instance
- Added command-line arguments:
  - `--basic` or no args: Run only basic tests
  - `--all`: Run all tests including those from separate files

### 3. Test Files Already Configured
All existing test files were already set up to import from `test_runner_base`:
- `test_accept_while_calling.py` - AcceptWhileCallingTest
- `test_call_busy_user.py` - CallBusyUserTest
- `test_call_queue.py` - CallQueueTest
- `test_overlapping_calls.py` - OverlappingCallsTest
- `test_rapid_redial.py` - RapidRedialTest
- `test_triple_call.py` - TripleCallTest

### 4. Created Documentation
- `README_TESTS.md` - Comprehensive test documentation
- `TESTS_SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `validate_tests.py` - Validation script

## How to Use

### Run Basic Tests Only
```bash
python tests.py
```

### Run All Tests (Recommended)
```bash
python tests.py --all
```

### Run Individual Test Files
```bash
python test_accept_while_calling.py
python test_call_busy_user.py
python test_call_queue.py
python test_overlapping_calls.py
python test_rapid_redial.py
python test_triple_call.py
```

### Validate Test Configuration
```bash
python validate_tests.py
```

## Test Coverage

### Basic Tests (from tests.py)
1. Authorization
2. Call Flow
3. Incoming Call Accept
4. Incoming Call Decline
5. Audio Controls

### Advanced Tests (from separate files)
1. Accept While Calling - User accepts call while already calling another user
2. Call Busy User - Attempting to call a user who is already in a call
3. Call Queue - Multiple users calling one user, testing queue handling
4. Overlapping Calls - Multiple overlapping calls between 4+ users
5. Rapid Redial - Quick repeated calls after declined/timeout
6. Triple Call Chain - A calls B, B calls C, establishes A-C connection

## Total Test Count
- **11 tests** total (5 basic + 6 advanced)
- All tests run with a single server instance when using `--all` flag
- Tests are properly isolated using multiprocessing

## Files Created/Modified

### Created:
- `test_runner_base.py` - Base infrastructure
- `README_TESTS.md` - Documentation
- `TESTS_SUMMARY.md` - This summary
- `validate_tests.py` - Validation script

### Modified:
- `tests.py` - Updated to use base infrastructure and add test discovery

### Unchanged:
- All test_*.py files (already had correct imports)
